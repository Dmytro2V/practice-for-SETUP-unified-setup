# Setting up your computer for AppAcademy

In order to be successful in the course, your computer needs to be setup in a
very specific way. If the setup is correct, you will not waste your time
fighting the setup of tools and applications, so you can concentrate on the new
material you are learning.

First, head to the guide for your particular operating system. This will give
you an overview of anything in particular you should be aware of for your
system.

From there, you can proceed to the individual sections for installing Google
Chrome, Visual Studio Code, Node.JS, Python, and Docker.

> Important, if you have an Apple Silicon Mac be sure to read the
